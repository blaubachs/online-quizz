# Online Coding Quiz

## Description

The motivation for this project was to expand my skills with javascript specifically. I built a short quiz game, with a few coding questions. I learned a lot about how to break large problems into smaller steps, so that they are more managable and create a better workflow with my javascript.

## Installation
